For 7 and fifty years, he served his sentence in silence, never raising a hand, never trying to fight back. Four more years and it would be the end for him. He knew it, as did the Gods. One can be safe in assuming that he was contended with the way things were going. 

On the cusp of his 60th name day, it all changed. He grew restless by the day, and at night sleep seemed a mercy he was denied constantly. Every minute of his remaining breath felt part of some grand scheme. Or so he led himself to believe.

Soon he started noticing things - that till then seemed too small and abstract for anyone to be paying much notice. He was surprised to realise that he was the only prisoner not to be held in chains, a thing that brought a smile to his face every time he thought of it. He was amused at first and later irritated to find that the guards always brought him food that was cold and partly eaten. His mild existence ensured that the guards barely ever gave him a second glance. Whoever was guarding his cell during the night always fell asleep in between their watch. A fact not changed by his constant muttering during the nights.
He began to wonder if others felt the same.

By the end of his 60th name day, he made up his mind to walk out of his imprisonment. No longer will he suffer in silence. It was time to let the world know. Through most of his he had been a passing cloud, always observing and staying clear of lightningâ€™s way. Not anymore he vowed.

All this because of a dream!
